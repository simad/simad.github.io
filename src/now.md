I still live in London, yearning to move to the countryside. I still struggle with wanting to be everywhere but here.
I am about to take a few months break from work; meanwhile, I am building a game (about hacking... nerd) and having a blast.

AI has not taken my job yet, but I am nevertheless ready for my full-time farmer/pirate (haven't decided yet) era.
