I am currently in Italy, about to move to sunny Malta. Well, that was not exactly what I had planned, but such is life sometimes.

I have started a masters in Applied Neuroscience at King's College, and I am pretty stoked about it.

AI has not taken my job yet, but I am nevertheless ready for my full-time farmer/pirate/scientist era.
