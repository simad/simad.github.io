Backt to work on the awesome [GOV.UK Pay](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/) platform. I am quite proud of having seen the platform scale from 0 payments to over [Â£1m processed](https://www.gov.uk/performance/govuk-pay) per week.

We use lots of different technologies ([Java 8](https://www.java.com/), JavaScript, Node, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and many, many others) and all of our code is [open-source](https://github.com/alphagov).
