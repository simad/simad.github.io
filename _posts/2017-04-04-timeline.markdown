Joined a 2-people startup, working on some cool tech revolving around [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) Grid. It took me around 3 weeks to realise that the startup grind is not for me, right now.
Worked mainly with [Angular.js](https://angular.io/) and [Java 8](https://www.java.com/), with lots of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) sprinkled in the mix.
